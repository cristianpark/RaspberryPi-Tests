# RaspberryPi-Tests
This repository will hold the different use cases I'll have with the Raspberry Pi 5 I got recently.

Ideas:
1. Create a SFTP (to evaluate best approach) to give a solution for a shared drive to mount in the different devices, self-hosted and that is available online with proper security stack.
2. Provide a self-hosted solution for Password Manager tool to keep passwords secure and accesible everywhere.
3. Add local streaming services (like Plex) for private usage.
4. Host a web app using latest technologies to provide a self-hosted Data Assets Inventory solution.
